Given an integer array nums and a target value target, return two indices of the two numbers (not their values) that add up to the target. You can assume that there is exactly one solution, and you cannot use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order. Example 1: Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [0,1] Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 9, we return [0,1]. Example 2: Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6 Output: [1,2] Example 3: Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6 Output: [0,1] Constraints: -2 <= nums.length <= 10^4 -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9 -10^9 <= target <= 10^9 There is only one valid answer.
